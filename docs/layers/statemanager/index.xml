      <description>In Memory State Manager This State Manager stores the data of events to provide the actual value of a datastream quickly when the third system send a get request. This means, that the State Manager has an internal State that it refreshes every time that an event arrives.
When an event arrives, the state manager applies the rules defined for that datastream and refreshes the stored value. The rules can change the value or not, either case the value is stored.</description>

      <description>Real Time State Manager This State Manager will process directly any operation or event that arrives to it. This means, that the incoming value isn&amp;rsquo;t processed in the state manager and the rule engine is not used.
When a event arrives, the state manager will send it directly to the third system, and the sent the value as it comes.
When a get operation arrives, the state manager will get the value from the datastream source.</description>
