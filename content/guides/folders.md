We explain here the different folders that compose ODA:

* Configuration

    Stores all configuration files used by ODA bundles. If ODA is running, changes made in these configuration files are loaded instantly.

* Deploy

    Stores all ODA bundles that are installed in the framework.

    If we add a new bundle in this folder, the framework will install and start it.

    If we remove a bundle from this bundle, the framework will stop and uninstall it.

* Log

    Stores the log files generated by ODA.

    The file ODA.log contains the log of the current day.

    The logs of previous days are saved in _archived_ folder.

* Bundle

    Stores all bundles that are not part of ODA (Apache Felix framework bundles, log, etc).
