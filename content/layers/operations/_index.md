### Operations

The operation layer contains operations that can be executed by the device.

This operations have to be sent to the device by the third system.

The [API module](https://github.com/amplia-iiot/oda/tree/master/oda-operations/api) has the basic operation definitions and the custom operations interface.

#### Basic Operations

The basic operations are:

* __[Refresh Info](refreshinfo)__: Send the values of the datastreams at the moment the operation is received.
* __[Get Device Parameters](getdeviceparameters)__: Get the values of the specified datastreams at the moment the operation is received.
* __[Set Device Parameters](setdeviceparameters)__: Set the given values in the specified datastreams.
* __[Set Clock](setclock)__: Set the clock of the specified device with the given timestamp.
* __[Synchronize Clock](synchronizeclock)__: Synchronize the clock of the specified device with the given source.
* __[Discover](discover)__: Send a discovery command to all devices in the LAN network to register themselves.
* __[Update](update)__: Make a software or configuration update in the device.

#### Custom Operations

The [CustomOperation](https://github.com/amplia-iiot/oda/blob/master/oda-operations/api/src/main/java/es/amplia/oda/operation/api/CustomOperation.java)
interface allows to add operation specific to project needs easily, without modifying the operations api modules and operation dispatcher.

```java
public interface CustomOperation {
    CompletableFuture<Result> execute(String deviceId, Map<String, Object> params);
    String getOperationSatisfied();
}
```

To implement a custom operation you should deploy a new OSGi bundle with a registered service implementing the __execute__
method. Usually, this method should extract the operation params from the params generic map, execute the operation and
return a result object with all the necessary information about the operation execution. It also has to define which
operation is responsible for through the __getOperationSatisfied__ method.

It's important to implement the operation knowing that the params (parameters) of the operation will be an array of objects
with two values:

* name: name of the parameter
* value: value of the parameter

The JSON message that the third platform will send to ODA to do a custom operation will be a format like this:

```JSON
{
    "operation": {
        "request": {
            "timestamp": "<timestampOfTheSendingOperation>",
            "deviceId": "<deviceOfTheTarget>",
            "name": "<nameOfTheOperation>",
            "parameters": [{
                "name": "parameter1",
                "value": "value1"
            }, {
                "name": "parameter2",
                "value": "value2"
            }],
            "id": "<idOfTheOperation>"
        }
    }
}
```
