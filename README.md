# ODA Documentation

ODA, responding to OpenGate Device Agent, is the software created by Ampl√≠a Soluciones S.L. to easily integrate your device data into our OpenGate IoT platform.

This repository holds the source code of the public documentation for ODA.

Visit the ODA documentation following [this link](https://amplia-iiot.github.io/oda-docs/).

## Generation

The ODA documentation uses Hugo's static site generator. If you are deploying a new version of the ODA documentation, don't forget to run this command before pushing the new documentation to the repository:

```bash
hugo -d docs
```

Enjoy ODA!
